## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is AdUnblock and how does it work?">
    AdUnblock is a service that detects when visitors to your website are using ad blockers and helps you recover lost revenue by displaying alternative content or messages. It works by using advanced detection algorithms to identify ad blocker behavior, then showing customizable messages to encourage users to whitelist your site or engage with alternative monetization options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is AdUnblock legal to use?">
    Yes, AdUnblock is completely legal. It simply detects the presence of ad blockers and displays messages to users - it doesn't bypass or disable ad blockers. Users always retain full control over their ad blocker settings and can choose whether to whitelist your site or not.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will AdUnblock slow down my website?">
    No, AdUnblock is designed to be lightweight and fast. The script is less than 10KB, loads asynchronously, and uses efficient detection methods that don't impact your page load times. Most users won't notice any performance difference.
