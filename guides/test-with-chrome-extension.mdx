# Test With Chrome Extension

Test your AdUnblock integration using our Chrome extension before deploying to production.

<Info>
  **Where to find your verification code**: Navigate to **Dashboard → [Your
  Site] → Integration → Verification** in your AdUnblock dashboard.
</Info>

<Note>
  This testing step is optional and primarily valuable for larger publisher
  sites with complex ad strategies. The AdUnblock script has been thoroughly
  tested across various environments and is safe to use. Most sites can proceed
  directly to implementation without preliminary testing.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Before testing, ensure you have the following setup: - Register your site in
    the AdUnblock dashboard - Install an ad blocker extension (like AdBlock or
    AdBlock Plus) in Chrome - Verify the ad blocker is enabled for your test
    site - This setup is necessary to confirm AdUnblock works correctly by
    showing ads despite the ad blocker
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Chrome Extension">
    Install the AdUnblock Devtool Chrome extension to test your integration:
    
    - Visit [**AdUnblock Devtool**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adunblock-devtool/gnlaoijjmmehcmccdkmbbcmmlpegcpmi) in the Chrome Web Store
    - Click **Add to Chrome** to install the extension
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Website">
    Use the extension to test the AdUnblock script on your website: - Navigate
    to your website in Chrome - Click the **AdUnblock Devtool** extension icon
    in your browser toolbar - Enter your **Verification Code**:
    `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` - Enter the **Script URL**:
    `https://adblock.static-cloudflare.workers.dev/index.js` - Click **Apply to
    Current Tab** - The page will automatically reload with the AdUnblock script
    injected
    <Warning>
      Your verification code is domain-specific, so you can only test on your
      own registered website. This extension is for testing purposes only before
      implementing a permanent integration.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Integration">
    After the page reloads with the AdUnblock script, verify the following: ✅
    **Website Functions Normally**: Your site should work without any issues ✅
    **Ads Are Visible**: Ads should display even with an ad blocker installed If
    both conditions are met, your integration is successful! You can now proceed
    with implementing a permanent solution using one of our integration guides.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Code

Your unique verification code (shown as `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` in the examples above) is required for AdUnblock to verify your integration. This code is specific to your registered domain.

## Available Script Sources

We provide multiple CDN endpoints to enhance reliability. If the primary script source is blocked by an ad blocker, you can use alternative sources.

<Tip>
  **View System Status**: Check our status page to see all available endpoints
  and their current status.
</Tip>

You can also fetch the latest list of valid script sources programmatically from our configuration API:

```
https://config.adunblocker.com/server-tag.json
```
