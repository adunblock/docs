# HTML/JavaScript Integration

AdUnblock provides simple HTML/JavaScript integration that works with any website and requires no additional dependencies.

<Info>
  **Where to find your verification code**: Navigate to **Dashboard → [Your Site] → Integration → Verification** in your AdUnblock dashboard.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Ad blockers regularly update their rules, and CDN endpoints may become blocked over time. As a site owner, you are responsible for using the latest valid CDN endpoints by regularly checking the System Status page or implementing server-side fetching from `https://config.adunblocker.com/server-tag.json`.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Script">
    Add the following script to your website's `<head>` section:
    
    ```html
    <script src="https://adblock.static-01.workers.dev/index.js" async data-code="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE"></script>
    ```
    
    **Important:** Replace `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` with your unique verification code from the dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Server-side Integration (Recommended)">
    For production environments, implement server-side fetching from our API with proper caching.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Integration">
    After adding the script, verify your integration is working properly by navigating to your site and checking if the ads are visible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Code

Your unique verification code (shown as `YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE` in the examples above) is required for AdUnblock to verify your integration. This code is specific to your registered domain.

## Available Script Sources

We provide multiple CDN endpoints to enhance reliability. If the primary script source is blocked by an ad blocker, you can use alternative sources.

<Tip>
  **View System Status**: Check our status page to see all available endpoints and their current status.
</Tip>

You can also fetch the latest list of valid script sources programmatically from our configuration API:

```
https://config.adunblocker.com/server-tag.json
```

### Important Notice

As a site owner, you are responsible for ensuring your integration uses the latest valid CDN endpoints. Ad blockers regularly update their rules, which may block our endpoints. We recommend:

- Regularly check the System Status page for updated endpoint information
- For production environments, implement server-side fetching from our API with proper caching
- Use the API endpoint `https://config.adunblocker.com/server-tag.json` to programmatically retrieve the latest valid scripts
- Never implement client-side fallbacks that fetch from our API directly
