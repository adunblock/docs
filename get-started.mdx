# Getting Started

AdUnblock is a powerful service that helps websites recover lost revenue from ad blockers by detecting when users have ad blockers enabled and presenting alternative content or messages to encourage whitelisting.

## What is AdUnblock?

AdUnblock is a lightweight JavaScript solution that:

- **Detects ad blockers** with high accuracy across all major browsers
- **Recovers lost revenue** by showing alternative content to users with ad blockers
- **Improves user experience** with customizable messages and designs
- **Provides detailed analytics** on ad blocker usage and recovery rates

## How it works
